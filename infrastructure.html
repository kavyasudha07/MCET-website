    <h2>Classrooms and Laboratories</h2>
    <p>
        The institution provides spacious, well-ventilated classrooms designed to
        support effective teaching and learning. Classrooms are arranged to ensure
        proper visibility, comfortable seating, and an environment that encourages
        interaction between students and faculty. Many classrooms are equipped with
        digital teaching aids such as projectors and audio systems to enhance the
        learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Laboratories play a crucial role in engineering education, and the college
        maintains well-equipped laboratories for all departments. These labs enable
        students to apply theoretical concepts through practical experiments and
        hands-on training. Regular maintenance, calibration of equipment, and timely
        upgrades ensure that laboratory facilities remain aligned with academic
        requirements and technological advancements.
    </p>

    <h2>Campus Maintenance and Housekeeping</h2>
    <p>
        A clean and well-maintained campus contributes significantly to a positive
        academic environment. The institution follows systematic housekeeping
        practices under the supervision of non-teaching staff and floor supervisors.
        Daily cleaning of classrooms, laboratories, offices, and sanitation facilities
        is carried out to maintain hygiene standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water availability, electrical systems, furniture condition, plumbing lines,
        and building safety are monitored regularly. Minor repairs and maintenance
        works are addressed promptly using skilled local personnel, ensuring minimal
        disruption to academic activities. Periodic inspections help maintain campus
        safety and functionality throughout the academic year.
    </p>

    <h2>Computer Centre and IT Facilities</h2>
    <p>
        The college has a modern computer center equipped with high-performance
        systems to support academic, research, and project-based activities.
        Computers are configured with updated hardware and software to meet the
        requirements of programming, simulation, design, and data analysis tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dedicated systems are provided for internet browsing, software development,
        and academic research. Licensed software, open-source tools, and virtual
        laboratory platforms are made available to students as per curriculum needs.
        Regular updates ensure that students gain exposure to current technologies
        and industry-relevant tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet and Digital Infrastructure</h2>

        Campus-wide LAN connectivity and Wi-Fi access support digital learning and
        administrative operations. High-speed internet enables access to online
        learning platforms, digital libraries, research databases, and virtual labs.
        Departments are equipped with ICT tools such as LCD projectors, printers,
        scanners, and smart classroom facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Uninterrupted power supply systems ensure continuity of academic and
        administrative functions. The institution continuously upgrades its IT
        infrastructure to keep pace with evolving educational and technological
        demands.
